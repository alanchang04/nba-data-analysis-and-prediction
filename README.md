# 🏀 NBA Data Analysis & Match Prediction

This project is a comprehensive data-driven exploration of NBA team performance. It combines **data visualization**, **statistical modeling**, and **machine learning techniques** to analyze trends and predict game outcomes between teams during regular seasons and playoffs.

---

## 📊 Overview

The project is divided into three main components:

### 1. 📈 Power BI Dashboard – Player & Team Comparison
- Created an interactive dashboard to compare:
  - Individual player stats
  - Position-based performance
  - Team-level offensive/defensive metrics
- Visual tools help identify top-performing teams and players in different contexts

### 2. 📊 R with Random Forest – Playoff Factors Analysis
- Used R to analyze **basic and advanced stats**
- Built a **Random Forest model** to assess the importance of various team features for **predicting playoff success**
- Explored metrics like offensive rating, pace, net rating, and true shooting %

### 3. 🤖 Python Machine Learning – Match Outcome Prediction
- Collected multi-season team statistics from reliable NBA data sources
- Engineered features including:
  - Home/Away status
  - Recent performance trends
  - Player injuries (where available)
- Built and compared multiple models:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
  - **Transformer-based model (with HuggingFace)**
- Separate models for **regular season** and **playoff** predictions
